It is a ready-to-use library containing static methods to accurately solve targeting problems (ballistics), and to predict key projectile data. It also describes our </span><strong><span>deterministic, math-based</span></strong><span> trajectory prediction solution.</span></p><p><em><span>PEB Trajectory Predictor</span></em><span> describes our </span><strong><span>physics-engine-based</span></strong><span> trajectory prediction solution, designed to predict in-game behavior exactly.</span></p><p><span>There are three different ways to do trajectory prediction in total.

(See </span><em><span>Projectile Aerodynamics &gt; Template Usage Guide</span></em><span> for details).</span></p><p><span>Announcement: we are evolving this toolkit into a low-code-first, template-driven asset that is immune to LLM disruption. In other words, even if you are using the most cutting-edge AI coding tools, you still need this :)</span></p><p><span>Next release will be the propulsion update!</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h6 id='november-17-2024'><span>November 17, 2024</span></h6><p><span>Introducing Projectile Aerodynamics, a brand new feature that models aerodynamic forces on projectiles without compromising their ability to hit targets.</span></p><p><span>You can use this feature to make curved trajectory seen in sports such as football, baseball, golf (draw/fade), etc. You can also use it to model wind, air drag, or implement creative weapons, like boomerangs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h6 id='november-5-2023-|-last-edit-august-19-2025'><span>November 5, 2023 | Last edit: August 19, 2025</span></h6><p><span>In the upcoming update, some gameplay-focused features will be available:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Getting the information of predicted collisions, including the index, position, rotation and velocity of collisions.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Thanks to the feature mentioned above,</span></p><ul><li><p><span>&quot;Collision Count Limit&quot; can restrict the prediction so that it stops when a certain collision count is reached.</span></p></li><li><p><span>You can display the collision points (where the collisions happened).</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p>✅<span> [Finished] Predicting wind, or draw/fade effects (internally achieved by taking one additional consistent force into account).</span></p></li><li><p>✅<span> [Finished] Simulating projectile movement that is affected by aerodynamics or wind, such as draw/fade effects.</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h6 id='april-15-2023'><span>April 15, 2023</span></h6><p><span>Projectile Toolkit 2.0 is available! Introducing PEB Trajectory Predictor, a brand new system that invokes physics engine to simulate future frames and thus gives accurate prediction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h6 id='september-3-2022'><span>September 3, 2022</span></h6><ul><li><p><span>Version 1.1 coming this week! (Edit: released)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Now you can check out some future features of Projectile Toolkit (work in progress):</span></p><ol start='' ><li><p><span>PEB Trajectory Predictor: a high-performance, physics-scene-simulated trajectory prediction component.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Propulsion Library/Engine (Drone Example).</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The demos are under &quot;WIP&quot; section of the WebGL demo linked in the Unity Asset Store page.</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h6 id='july-17-2022'><span>July 17, 2022</span></h6><p><span>I&#39;m working on Version 1.1:</span></p><p><span>In this version, I&#39;ve added two new algorithms and improved several things:</span></p><ul><li><p><code>TimeOfFlight(...)</code><span>, which calculates the flight duration of a projectile to hit the target,</span></p></li><li><p><code>ElevationalReach(...)</code><span>, which calculates the maximum range a projectile can reach at a specified launch speed to a specified elevation,</span></p></li><li><p><span>Character Movement Kit: new Forward Vector parameter added, now you can define the character&#39;s forward direction. New Rotation Speed parameter added, helps you fine tune the rotation animation of your characters.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The targeting algorithms now get a &quot;/0&quot; check improvement: when start point and end point have the same x and z values, this will cause an error, and now they won&#39;t.</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h6 id='july-9-2022'><span>July 9, 2022</span></h6><p><span>I am working hard to bring new features and utilities to Projectile Toolkit. In addition to the new functionalities for targeting and trajectory prediction, one important area I am working on is the propulsion library.</span></p><p><span>I&#39;ve realized that there</span>&#39;<span>re much more things I can do than just bring you some simple functions that convert between force and velocity, and after some </span>&quot;<span>chaotic</span>&quot;<span> iterations, I successfully implemented the first advanced method of propulsion library.</span></p><p><span>After that, I was like </span>&quot;<span>why not make a simple drone with the method to test it out? It will behave weird, but it will be very fun</span>&quot;<span>. But the result blows my mind, it is PERFECT! I used four propulsion engines, and use </span><code>AddForceAtPosition(..., ForceMode.Force)</code><span> to add continuous propulsion to the drone body, and everything just works in harmony, and works like a charm!</span></p><p><span>See the video showing the result </span><a href='https://blobcreate.github.io/projectile-toolkit/videos/propulsion drone.webm'><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div>
