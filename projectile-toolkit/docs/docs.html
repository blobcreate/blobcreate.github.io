New Rotation Speed parameter added, helps you fine tune the rotation animation of your characters.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The targeting algorithms now get a &quot;/0&quot; check improvement: when start point and end point have the same x and z values, this will cause an error, and now they won&#39;t.</span></p></li></ul></div></div>
